- Hi, I’m Tyler M., @TheCodingMarine.
- I'm an autodidact, charting my learning paths and goals in detailed spreadsheets.
- I’m interested in Python, algorithms, web-development, data science, and machine learning.
- I’m currently learning Flask, algorithms, and data structures.
- I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, algorithm implementation, web application development, building Python modules, and extending Python with C++.
