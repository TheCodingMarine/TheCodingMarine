- 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler M., @TheCodingMarine.
- I'm an autodidact and self-taught programmer. I chart my learning paths and goals in detailed spreadsheets.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, algorithms, web development, data science, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flask, algorithms, and data structures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, algorithm implementation, web application development, building Python modules, and extending Python with C++.
- 📫 Best place to reach me is here or via email.
