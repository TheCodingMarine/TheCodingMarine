Hello and welcome! My name is Tyler and I am a Python Developer. My studies and practice in Python consist of everything from web-development to CLI applications and even data science. I am an autodidact and self-taught in Python. My self-directed learning plans are meticulously laid out to include a deeper understanding of data science, web-development, algorithms and analysis, data structures, and becoming a world class Pythonista. My first language is C++ which I learned over the course of a semester in an engineering degree program. Languages I look to add or improve on in the future are JavaScript and C++. Both of which relating back to Python development for the web and extensions.

I use GitHub as a repository for projects but also maintain my own private Git server, so the activity tracker will not be truly reflective of how much coding I actually do.
